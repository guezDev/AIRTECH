            <h1>Who are us ?</h1>
            <p>AIRTECH is a artificial intelligence and robotics research center. The future is our common thread, our passion, our pillar. We are pushing our reflection on the limits of artificial intelligence in order to develop the most intelligent and autonomous technologies possible. The results of our research and technologies we implement are precious elements for organizations that request our services. Our services are based on <b>MAMACS</b>.

            <h1>What is <b>MAMACS</b></h1>
            <p>MAMACS is the term used by the company to designate the fields in which we work. This allows us to organize our facilities and to have different departments, each specializing in a field so as to produce services efficiently. You will understand, we work with organizations specialized in at least one of the <b>MAMACS</b>.</p>

                    In medicine, we mainly base our research on surgery and medical diagnosis. For surgery, we want to allow surgeons to know the best procedure to follow for the operation of a patient thanks to a device that collects informations on the many previous procedures. Quickly diagnoses efficiently are also subject to reflection. Basically in medicine, we want to make decision support tools.

                    In the army, tracking tools are at the heart of our thinking. Combat planes, missiles, drones and many other combat vehicles use them. We want to improve them so that they can track a criminal without the criminal having a chip or something like that to detect him, but rather by a wave that is going to be emitted in an area then will scan the people there, to identify the correct one. Robot soldiers are also developed to avoid significant human loss.

                    About music, we look to improve the tools of sound engineers for their studio work. We develop tools that can help to create original compositions that are pleasant to listen, inspired by the frequent desires of listeners for a genre of music. We are also developing robots that can reproduce the melody of a staff with any instrument. Tools that can generate the range of a melody are also worked on.

                    In automotive, we work mainly on the autonomous car. We write all programs allowing a car to drive without a driver: adaptive cruise control with stop function, collision risk alert, involuntary lane departure alert, park assist, safe stop, connected pilot , park pilot, night vision, driver attention monitoring and all other driving aids under or without supervision.

                    We develop mobile applications that allow to have a lot of informations about what we eat just by taking a picture of it. We also work on robot observers who can guide a person in the realization of a recipe, so correct it in case of error by voice. These robots must also be able to determine the ingredients needed to make a recipe and estimate the minimum amount for purchasing the ingredients of a recipe.

                    We are working to fully integrate artificial intelligence and robotics into sport because it is the solution to remedy all arbitration errors or injustices. We work for example in the improvement of the Video Assistant Referees (VAR) in football by giving the possibility of knowing the intensity of the shocks and thus better helping the referee in his decision-making.
